## Magyar Hangok: A Perceptual Trainer for Hungarian Phoenetics

As an armchair neuroscientist and native (non-bilingual) English speaker,
I'm aware that
my perceptual system is not tuned to perceive distinctions between certain
non-english phonemes. As children learn language, their brains adapt to
ignore differences between phonemes that do not affect the meaning of
utterances. For instance, in Japanese the "L" and "R" sounds are
interchangeable and irrelevant to the meanings of spoken Japanese words.
As a result, by adulthood most native Japanese speakers can no longer
perceive the difference between those sounds.

For those like myself attempting to learn new languages as adults this is
quite frustrating. However, there is hope! Even as an adult
the brain is still highly plastic and it is possible to improve (to some
extent) one's ability to distinguish between novel/similar
phonemes using practice with feedback.

Accordingly, I have created this very simple command line utility to play
Hungarian Phonemes, allow the user to attempt to identify the phoneme and
provide feedback about the user's accuracy.

## How to use
From your terminal ```cd``` to the directory containing the magyar_hangok.r
and the sounds folder. Then run the command:```Rscript magyar_hangok.r```.
Follow the prompts in the command line or use ```ctrl+z``` to exit.
