## Magyar Hangok: A Perceptual Trainer for Hungarian Phoenetics

As an armchair neuroscientist and native (non-bilingual) English speaker,
I'm aware that
my perceptual system is not tuned to perceive distinctions between certain
non-english phonemes. As a child learning language, the brain adapts to ignore
differences between phonemes that are not relevant to one's native language.
For instance, adult native Japanese speakers generally have neural circuitry that
physically cannot hear the difference between "l" and "r" because in Japanese
these sounds are interchangeable and irrelevant to the meanings of sounds.)
However, even as an adult the brain is still highly plastic and it is possible
to improve (to some extent) one's ability to distinguish between novel/similar
phonemes using practice with feedback.

Accordingly, I have created this very simple command line utility to play
Hungarian Phonemes, allow the user to guess the phoneme and provide feedback
about the users accuracy.

## How to use
From your terminal ```cd``` to the directory containing the magyar_hangok.r
and the sounds folder. Then run the command:```Rscript magyar_hangok.r```.
Follow the prompts in the command line or use ```ctrl+z``` to exit.
